            <p>The problem asks to find the number of subarrays in an array $\texttt{cows}$ such that the left and right values of the subarray occur exactly once in the subarray. </p>

            <p>Let #subarrays with left value repeated $=A$ and #subarrays with right value repeated $=B$.
		If we complementary count, the answer is $n(n-1)/2 - (A+B-A\cap B)$</p>

            <p>The first two quantities of the complement are straightforward to find, but the third is trickier. For now we focus on computing $\text{A}$,
		as we can do some modifications to the setup and repeat the same procedure to get $\text{B}$.</p>

	    <p>
		We can go through $\texttt{cows}$ and increment $\text{A}$ for each index $i$, letting $i$ be the left position of the subarrays we count.
		If $j$ is the next occurrence of $\texttt{cows[i]}$ (if there is no next occurrence let $j=n+1$), we increment $\text{A}$ by $n-j+1$ because
                we are counting all subarrays with right end in the range $[j, n]$. Now to find $\text{B}$ we reverse $\texttt{cows}$ and do the same process.

	    </p>

	    <p>
		$A \cap B$ can be computed simultaneously with $\text{A}$. We can precompute the closest index with the same value to the right $\texttt{cr}$ and left $\texttt{cl}$ for all
	        indices. If either $\texttt{cr[i]}$ or $\texttt{cl[i]}$ do not exist, let it be $0$. Then for index $i$, if $j=\texttt{cr[i]}$, we are looking for the number of $k \geq j$ such that $\texttt{cl[k]} \geq i$.
                We subtract that from the current $A$. For example,
		$$\texttt{cows=[1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5]}$$ If $i=2$, we first find the raw addition which is $3$. Then we count the number of $k \geq 5$ such that $\texttt{cl[k]} \geq 2$, which is $2$.
		This can be done with a fenwick tree, with the condition of $\texttt{cl[k]} \geq i$ being maintained with a mapping from $\texttt{cl[k]}$ to $k$. Whenever $\texttt{cl[k]} < i$
		we remove $k$ from the fenwick tree. Time and space complexity is $O(n\log{n})$.
